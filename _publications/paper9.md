Abstract: It has been evidenced by numerous studies that irrational investor sentiment is one of the critical factors leading to dramatic volatility in financial market prices. Therefore, how to effectively predict market prices by information on investor sentiment is a popular but complex topic for researchers, market investors, and financial regulators. In this research, we aim to investigate the effectiveness of stock index prediction using multiple investor sentiment features, and we propose an advanced price trend prediction and trading simulation approach for the Shanghai Stock Exchange index and the Shenzhen Component index by integrating the Boosting, Bagging, and NSGA-II methods. Additionally, the SHAP method is employed as a model interpretation approach to analyze the importance of the sentiment variables and quantify their contributions to the predictions from both local and global perspectives. According to the experimental results, it can be found that the proposed method outperforms the benchmark methods in terms of the hit ratio, accumulated return, and maximum drawdown. It indicates that the proposed method is capable of achieving high accuracy, low risk, and stable profit in price trend prediction and trading simulation of the Chinese stock indexes. Moreover, the SHAP approach incorporated in the proposed method improved the interpretability of the proposed model, which can provide a beneficial reference for market participants to clarify the important sentiment factors and make relative decisions.
